# Inheritance in Python

This documentation provides an overview of inheritance in Python, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and organization.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows a new class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the parent or superclass). This mechanism enables subclasses to extend or modify the functionality of superclasses.

## Basic Terminology

- **Superclass (Parent Class)**: The class from which other classes inherit.
- **Subclass (Child Class)**: The class that inherits from another class.

## Example: Car and ElectricCar Classes

This example demonstrates how inheritance works in Python by defining a `Car` class and an `ElectricCar` subclass.

### Superclass: Car

The `Car` class defines basic attributes and methods that are common to all cars.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} is starting.")

    def stop(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} is stopping.")
```

### Subclass: ElectricCar

The `ElectricCar` class inherits from the `Car` class and adds additional functionality specific to electric cars.

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_size):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.battery_size = battery_size

    def charge(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} is charging.")

    def start(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} (electric) is starting silently.")
```

### Explanation

- **Inheritance Syntax**: The `ElectricCar` class is defined with the syntax `class ElectricCar(Car):`, indicating that it inherits from the `Car` class.
- **`super()` Function**: Used to call the constructor of the superclass (`Car`) to initialize common attributes.
- **Overriding Methods**: The `ElectricCar` class overrides the `start` method of the `Car` class to provide a different implementation.

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how to create and use objects of the `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes:

```python
# Creating a Car object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.start()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla is starting.
my_car.stop()   # Output: The Toyota Corolla is stopping.

# Creating an ElectricCar object
my_electric_car = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", 100)
my_electric_car.start()  # Output: The Tesla Model S (electric) is starting silently.
my_electric_car.stop()   # Output: The Tesla Model S is stopping.
my_electric_car.charge() # Output: The Tesla Model S is charging.

# Accessing attributes
print(my_electric_car.brand)        # Output: Tesla
print(my_electric_car.model)        # Output: Model S
print(my_electric_car.battery_size) # Output: 100
```

## Benefits of Inheritance

- **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to reuse existing code, reducing redundancy.
- **Organized Codebase**: Inheritance helps in organizing code into hierarchical structures, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Extendability**: Subclasses can extend the functionality of superclasses without modifying the original class.

## Summary

- **Inheritance** allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass.
- The subclass can add new attributes and methods or override existing ones.
- The `super()` function is used to call methods of the superclass from the subclass.
- In the example, `ElectricCar` is a subclass of `Car` that inherits all its attributes and methods and adds some specific to electric cars.

## Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that promotes code reusability and simplifies the creation of hierarchical class structures. It allows you to build upon existing classes and extend their functionality without modifying the original class.
