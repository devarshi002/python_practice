# Car Class in Python

This documentation provides an overview and explanation of a basic `Car` class implemented in Python. The `Car` class serves as an example of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including class definition, object creation, and attribute access.

## Class Definition

The `Car` class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of a car object.

### Code

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
```

### Explanation

- **`class Car:`**: This line defines a new class named `Car`.
  - **`class`**: A keyword used to define a class in Python.
  - **`Car`**: The name of the class, written in PascalCase (each word starts with a capital letter).

- **`def __init__(self, brand, model):`**: This line defines the constructor method of the class.
  - **`def`**: A keyword used to define a function or method.
  - **`__init__`**: A special method in Python classes, known as the constructor. It is automatically called when a new object of the class is created.
  - **`self`**: A reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.
  - **`brand, model`**: Parameters passed to the constructor to initialize the object's attributes.

- **`self.brand = brand`**: This line assigns the value of the `brand` parameter to the `brand` attribute of the object.
  - **`self.brand`**: An attribute of the object, storing the brand of the car.
  - **`= brand`**: Assigns the value of the parameter `brand` to the `brand` attribute.

- **`self.model = model`**: Similarly, this line assigns the value of the `model` parameter to the `model` attribute of the object.

## Creating an Object

To create an object (or instance) of the `Car` class, use the following syntax:

```python
# Creating a Car object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
```

- **`my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")`**: This line creates a new object of the `Car` class and passes the values `"Toyota"` and `"Corolla"` to the `__init__` method.
  - **`my_car`**: A variable that stores the new `Car` object.
  - **`Car("Toyota", "Corolla")`**: Calls the `Car` class and creates a new `Car` object with the specified brand and model.

## Accessing Attributes

After creating an object, you can access its attributes using the dot notation:

```python
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.model)  # Output: Corolla
```

- **`my_car.brand`**: Accesses the `brand` attribute of the `my_car` object.
- **`my_car.model`**: Accesses the `model` attribute of the `my_car` object.

## Full Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

# Creating a Car object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

# Accessing attributes
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.model)  # Output: Corolla
```

## Summary

- The **`Car` class** is a blueprint for creating car objects.
- The **`__init__` method** is the constructor that initializes the attributes `brand` and `model` for each new object.
- **`self`** is a reference to the current object, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
- When creating a new `Car` object, you pass the brand and model as arguments to the constructor.
- You can access the object's attributes using dot notation (`my_car.brand`).

## Conclusion

This `Car` class example demonstrates the basics of class definition, object creation, and attribute access in Python. It serves as a foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming concepts.
